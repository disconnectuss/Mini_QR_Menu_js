- This project is a web-based menu system developed using JavaScript and Bootstrap, designed to provide an efficient and user-friendly way for customers to access detailed product information at a glance. By simply scanning a QR code, customers can explore a restaurant or business's menu items, descriptions, prices, and more.

- It can be improved by adding order, basket or favorites settings, then enjoy your favorite foods!! Bon appetite!
